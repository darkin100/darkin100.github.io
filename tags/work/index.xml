      <description>Earlier this year I completed a project with AIB focused on transforming their Mortgage Customer Experience. It was a great project as it was lead by the head of Customer Experience and it was focused on a real customer problem. Below is a video case study that was put together with AIB talking about the project, challenges and the digital tools we built to support it customer journey.

      <description>Earlier this year (2018) I was fortunate enough to be asked to do the keynote at the http://digitaltransformations.org/ conference. The context of this conference is slightly different to most tech confirences as it seeks to bring together technologists and artists and poses a number of cultural questions.

      <description>Building out an AWS infrastructure can get pretty complicated as there are many different elements and dependencies that need to be considered. Visualising the relationships is a great way to understand all the dependencies involved, however the existing tools may create results that were not exactly expected. The visualisations that I have been using are based on my Cloud Formation Scripts. These are static JSON files that AWS uses to build out the architecture.</description>
