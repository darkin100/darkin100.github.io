      <description>Earlier this year (2018) I was fortunate enough to be asked to do the keynote at the http://digitaltransformations.org/ conference. The context of this conference is slightly different to most tech confirences as it seeks to bring together technologists and artists and poses a number of cultural questions.
Introduction My name is Glyn Darkin, I am and IT consultant and spend my life helping my clients on their journey to being more digital.</description>

      <description>I have been wanting to build some furniture out of concrete for a while and whilst doing a home renovation I got the opportunity to build a small sink for a bedroom ensuite. After lots of research online this is the process I came up with including the lessons learned, lowlights and highlights.
The requirements for the sink are:
 it should fit an IKEA Godmorgan sink cabinet. there is no requirement for a hole for the tap as the tap is mounted on the wall.</description>

      <title>Visualising your AWS infrastructure</title>

      <description>Building out an AWS infrastructure can get pretty complicated as there are many different elements and dependencies that need to be considered. Visualising the relationships is a great way to understand all the dependencies involved, however the existing tools may create results that were not exactly expected. The visualisations that I have been using are based on my Cloud Formation Scripts. These are static JSON files that AWS uses to build out the architecture.</description>

      <description>As software is eating our world; how we buy, build and consume products is changing. This is a story about the Digital Economy and my experience dabbling in it.
Crowd funding It started about a year ago when I backed a new project on KickStarter. They had a nice idea for a Drone that could collapse down and fit in your pocket (large pocket). They had a slick video and got some good media attention.</description>
